Accept Bitcoin payments with Coinsnap for Easy Digital Downloads!

== Description ==

**Enable your customers to purchase your Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) offerings with Bitcoin/Satoshis.**

With the Coinsnap for Easy Digital Downloads payment add-on you only need a Lightning wallet with a Lightning address, a Coinsnap account, and a minute to connect the add-on with EDD and either your Coinsnap account or your BTCPay Server to accept Bitcoin Lightning payments on your WordPress website.

With this plugin you can then offer Bitcoin transactions of all kinds directly within products you create with EDD – you need no shop system, no other payment provider or anything else to sell e.g. downloads (videos, audio, software, other files), physical products, licenses, memberships, subscriptions etc.

Coinsnap’s Bitcoin payment add-on for Easy Digital Downloads makes it amazingly simple for your customers to purchase your offerings with Bitcoin-Lightning: They can make their transactions with just a scan of the QR code generated by the Coinsnap add-on, and their authorization of the payment. When authorized, the payment will be credited directly and immediately to your Lightning wallet.
